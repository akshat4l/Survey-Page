# Survey Form

A simple survey form created as part of a research project about cats. It collects basic user information and preferences about cats.

## Note

This is only my second project using HTML and CSS, made for a FreeCodeCamp project. Suggestions for improvement are welcome!

## Form Details

The form includes the following fields:

1. **Name** – User's full name (required)
2. **Email** – Email address (required)
3. **Age** – Age input (between 18 and 60, required)
4. **Favorite Cat** – Dropdown to choose between Siamese or Persian
5. **Preference** – Radio buttons for Indoor or Outdoor cat preference
6. **Personality Traits** – Checkboxes to select traits like Playful, Lazy, Friendly, or Shy
7. **Comments** – Optional text area for additional feedback

## How to Use

Open the `index.html` file in a browser, fill in the form, and hit "Submit" to send your responses.
